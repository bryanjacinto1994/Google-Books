# Google-Books

## `Summary`
'Google Books Search and Find' is an application, built upon React, that uses **react-router-dom** to navigate, hide and outputting the components without changing the routes within Express through the webpage. By displaying the books stored from Google Books' API database. The front-end React application will dynamically create its updated search results of books-- and the backend Express application will run independently. With the use of helper/utility functions, are we able to display and query the books
